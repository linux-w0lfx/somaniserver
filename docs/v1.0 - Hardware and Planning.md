# v1.0 â€“ Hardware and Initial Planning

## Objective
I kicked off `somaniserver` by setting clear goals: build a modular, private infrastructure that gives me full control over services, data, and system behavior â€” without relying on any public cloud.

## Hardware Setup

| Component     | Specs                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| CPU           | Intel Core i3-6100T           |
| RAM           | 20GB DDR4                     |
| Storage       | 2Ã—2TB HDD (ZFS Mirror) for main pool, 500GB HDD for Proxmox local storage |

This setup balances energy efficiency with reliability and ensures redundancy for important data using ZFS mirror.

## Planning Overview
From the start, I planned to:
  - Use [**Proxmox VE**](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) as the hypervisor for managing VMs
  - Run [**TrueNAS SCALE**](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-community-edition/) in a VM to manage the ZFS mirror pool and NFS shares
  - Create an [**Ubuntu Server VM**](https://ubuntu.com/server) to host containerized services like [Immich](https://immich.app/), [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/home-users/), and [Kasm](https://kasmweb.com/community-edition) via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  - Mount storage from TrueNAS to Ubuntu over [**NFS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System), keeping all data centralized and protected

## ðŸ”„ Version Note
This marks the foundation of the project. I created the `somaniserver` GitHub repository to document my progress and version every milestone â€” from hardware assembly to service deployment.

I'm actively working on this system, and v1.0 reflects the initial planning and setup stage that made everything else possible.
