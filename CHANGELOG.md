# CHANGELOG

## v1.0 â€“ Hardware & Infrastructure Planning (08/07/2025)

- Defined the overall objective: build a modular, self-hosted server environment
- Selected brand-new hardware components for virtualization and efficiency
- Planned initial architecture: Proxmox as base hypervisor, VMs for service isolation
- Outlined role of each VM (storage, services, control)
- Created the versioned documentation structure (`docs/`, `assets/`, `scripts/`)
- Initialized GitHub repository to track the full setup lifecycle
