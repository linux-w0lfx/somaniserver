# somaniserver

> Building a fully private, modular home server from the ground up — zero cloud, zero compromises.

---

## Project Overview

This project creates a self-hosted infrastructure designed for total control over storage, virtualization, and applications — all running on brand-new hardware.

Proxmox VE is used as the virtualization backbone, hosting VMs like TrueNAS SCALE for storage management and Ubuntu Server for containerized services such as Immich, Nextcloud, Seafile, and Kasm. The system emphasizes privacy, modularity, and long-term flexibility.
